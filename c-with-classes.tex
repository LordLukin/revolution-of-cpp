    Languages that were considered as a base of C++:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modula2
        \item Ada
        \item Smalltalk
        \item Mesa
        \item Clu

    Additions to C language:
    \begin{itemize}%[<+->]
        \item classes
        \item derived classes
        \item public and private access control
        \item constructors and destructors
        \item \textbf<2>{call and return functions (removed later)}
        \item friend classes
        \item type checking and conversion of function arguments

\slide{Roots of C++}{
    In C++ you can see the influence of 4 languages:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item C provided all base and syntax
        \item Simula provided classes and inheritance
        \item Algol68 provided:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item operator overloading, 
                \item references 
                \item ability to declare variables anywhere in a block  %NOTE: in C you had to declare variables first
            \end{itemize}
        \item BCPL provided // comments (later in 1985).
    \end{itemize}

\timeSlide{First standard library}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item complex numbers
        \item string
        \item later: iostreams

\slide{C with Classes - summary}{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Years of development: 1979-1983
        \item The idea was great
        \item The aim was clear:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item help programmers to organize code with classes
                \item without the loss of efficiency 
                \item and without requiring from users learning something completely new
            \end{itemize}
        \item C with Classes didn't have many users :( 
        \item It wouldn't pay to support this language in the form it was
        \item C with Classes was a "medium success"
    \end{itemize}
    Bjarne knew about it and drawn conclusions.

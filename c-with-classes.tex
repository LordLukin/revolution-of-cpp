\slide{C with Classes - summary}{
    \itemstep{
        \item Years of development: 1979-1983
        \item The idea was great
        \item The aim was clear:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item help programmers to organize code with classes
                \item without the loss of efficiency 
                \item and without requiring from users learning something completely new
            \end{itemize}
        \item C with Classes didn't have many users :( 
        \item It wouldn't pay to support this language in the form it was
        \item C with Classes was a "medium success"

\slide{The C++ Programming language - 1st edition (1983)}{
    %NOTE: Tell that Bjarne wrote this book to show people how to code in C++. They were reluctant to write Object Oriented code. They were skeptical. How do you learn anything new in programming? I guess that you do the same thing as I do. There are 2 schools.

    %NOTE: First is changing things and seeing what happens. It's easy. In that way I can learn many things.

    }
    %NOTE: These are really good books. I recommend them both.
    %NOTE: But the interesting fact is the opening line of that book. Bjarne put this text there:
    \begin{block}<4>{The opening line}
        \textit{``C++ is a general purpose programming language designed to make programming more enjoyable for the serious programmer''}
    \end{block}
    %NOTE: But reviewers weren't happy with that and couldn't believe that it was the main reason. Opening line was changed to below:
    \begin{block}<5>{The opening line}
        \textit{``C++ was designed primarily so that the author and his friends would not have to program in assembler, C, or various modern high-level languages. Its main purpose is to make writing good programs easier and more pleasant for the individual programmer''}
    \end{block}
    %NOTE: And it was accepted without any problems
